### üèçÔ∏è Boy Scout Rule <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/thenomaniqbal/thenomaniqbal/master/icon/rockstar.gif" width="40px">

I love open source.  I am not a heavy maintainer of any large libraries, but I really like the boyscout rule.  I contribute to things as I come across issues that I think other people might struggle with.  This may be things that are overlooked by someone who is deep into the library. I üíï a good onboarding readme with good example. Moreover, i learned a lot from the open-source community and i love how collaboration and knowledge sharing happenes through open-source.
